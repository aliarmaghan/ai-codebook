# 🤖 AI Learning & Experiments Repository

## 📌 Repository Description

This repository is a **living knowledge base and hands-on playground** where I continuously commit code, experiments, notes, and implementations related to **Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and Agentic Systems**.

It reflects my end-to-end learning journey—from **core concepts** to **production-grade architectures**—covering modern AI tooling, frameworks, research paper analysis, and evaluation methodologies. The goal of this repository is not just to *learn*, but to **build, test, evaluate, and reason about real-world AI systems**.

This repo is designed to be:

* 📘 A structured **learning archive**
* 🧪 A **research & experimentation lab**
* 🏗️ A foundation for **production-ready AI systems**
* 🎯 A portfolio showcasing **practical AI engineering skills**
